# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## 🐛 Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ Products Page 404 Error
**Problem:** Vercel was returning 404 for `/products` route  
**Cause:** SPA routing not configured properly  
**Fix:** Updated `vercel.json` with proper rewrites for React Router

### 2. ❌ Products Without Images
**Problem:** Some products had no images or broken image links  
**Cause:** Local asset paths that don't exist  
**Fix:** Added fallback to default phone image from Unsplash

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. `vercel.json` - Fixed SPA Routing
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
This ensures all routes go to `index.html` and React Router handles them.

### 2. `seedData.js` - Added Default Image
```javascript
export const DEFAULT_PHONE_IMAGE = 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511707171634-5f897ff02aa9?w=500&h=500&fit=crop';
```

### 3. `Home.js` - Uses Fallback Image
```javascript
<img
  src={getUploadedImageUrl(allImages[currentImageIndex]) || DEFAULT_PHONE_IMAGE}
  onError={(e) => {
    e.target.onerror = null;
    e.target.src = DEFAULT_PHONE_IMAGE;
  }}
/>
```
