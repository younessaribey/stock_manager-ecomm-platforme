# 🔧 Vercel CORS Error - FIXED ✅

## What Was Wrong

Your Vercel deployment was trying to call `http://localhost:5050/api` which:
- ❌ Only exists on your computer
- ❌ Not accessible from internet
- ❌ Has CORS only for `localhost:3000`

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated `client/src/config/appConfig.js`
```javascript
// Now defaults to DEMO MODE = true
DEMO_MODE: process.env.REACT_APP_DEMO_MODE === 'false' ? false : true
```

### 2. Created `vercel.json`
Sets environment variable for Vercel deployment:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "REACT_APP_DEMO_MODE": "true"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Fix - Deploy Now!

Just run these commands:

```bash
# 1. Add all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Enable demo mode for Vercel deployment"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

Vercel will **automatically redeploy** in ~2 minutes!

## ✅ After Deployment

Your site will:
- ✅ Run in DEMO MODE
