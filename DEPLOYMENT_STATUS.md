# 🚀 Vercel Deployment - Status Update

## ✅ Issue Fixed: ESLint Errors

### Problem
Build was failing with ESLint errors:
```
[eslint] 
src/pages/public/Home.js
  Line 4:8:  'axios' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars

src/pages/public/ProductsNew.js
  Line 3:8:  'axios' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars
```

### Solution
