## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Clear localStorage!

The products page loads from localStorage. You MUST clear it to see products:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Visit:** https://stock-manager-ecomm-platforme.vercel.app

2. **Open Console:** Press F12

3. **Clear Storage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

4. **Check Console Logs:**
   ```
   Products loaded: [array of 5 products]
   Categories loaded: [array of 7 categories]
   Demo data initialized successfully
   ```

---

## ✅ After Clearing Cache

### Homepage Should Show:
- ✅ 8 products with images

### Products Page Should Show:
- ✅ 5 products displayed
- ✅ All with images
- ✅ Filters working
- ✅ Search working
- ✅ Grid/List view toggle

### Console Should Show:
```
🎨 Running in DEMO MODE
📚 Demo credentials
Demo data initialized successfully
Products loaded: (5) [{...}, {...}, ...]
Categories loaded: (7) [{...}, {...}, ...]
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging

If products still don't show:

### 1. Check Console
Look for:
- `Products loaded:` - should show array with 5 items
- `Categories loaded:` - should show array with 7 items
- Any errors?

### 2. Check localStorage
In console, run:
```javascript
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('demo_products'))
```
Should show 5 products.

### 3. Hard Refresh
- Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

### 4. Clear All Site Data
1. F12 → Application tab
2. Clear storage
3. Reload

## 📊 Expected Results

### Products on /products page:
1. iPhone 14 Pro Max - $85,000
2. Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra - $75,000
3. iPhone 13 - $45,000
4. Xiaomi 13 Pro - $55,000
