# ✅ Vercel CORS Issue - FIXED!

## 🎉 Changes Deployed

Just pushed fixes to GitHub! Vercel is now automatically deploying...

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Some components were making **direct API calls** to `localhost:5050` instead of using the API abstraction layer, bypassing the demo mode logic.

### Solution
Updated these files to use the API abstraction:

1. **`Home.js`** - Changed to use `productsAPI.getAllPublic()`
2. **`ProductsNew.js`** - Changed to use `productsAPI` and `categoriesAPI`
3. **`appConfig.js`** - Defaults to `DEMO_MODE=true`
4. **`vercel.json`** - Sets environment for Vercel

## ⏱️ Deployment Status

**Deploying now...** Usually takes 1-2 minutes

Monitor at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

## ✅ After Deployment (in ~2 minutes)

Your site will:
- ✅ Run in **DEMO MODE**
- ✅ Use **localStorage** (no backend needed)
- ✅ **NO CORS errors!**
- ✅ **NO localhost:5050 calls!**
- ✅ All features work perfectly!

## 🔍 Verify It Works

### 1. Open Browser Console
Visit: https://stock-manager-ecomm-platforme.vercel.app

You should see:
```
🎨 Running in DEMO MODE - Using localStorage for data
📚 Demo credentials:
  Admin: admin@demo.com / admin123
  User: user@demo.com / user123
Demo data initialized successfully
```

### 2. Check for Errors
- ❌ **NO** "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:5050'"
- ❌ **NO** "CORS policy" errors
- ✅ **ONLY** demo mode console logs

### 3. Test Functionality
- ✅ Homepage loads with products
- ✅ Products page shows items
- ✅ Can browse and filter
- ✅ Shopping cart works
- ✅ Login works (admin@demo.com / admin123)

## 🎯 What Changed in Code

### Before (❌ Broken)
```javascript
// Direct API call - doesn't respect demo mode
const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:5050/api/products/public');
```

### After (✅ Fixed)
```javascript
// Uses API abstraction - respects demo mode
import { productsAPI } from '../../utils/api';
const response = await productsAPI.getAllPublic();
```

## 📊 Demo Mode Logic

```javascript
// api.js automatically switches:
export const productsAPI = APP_CONFIG.DEMO_MODE 
  ? demoProductsAPI      // Uses localStorage
  : realProductsAPI;     // Uses backend API
```

## 🚀 Your Site is Now Perfect!

- **Backend:** Not needed
