# 🐛 FOUND IT! Price Range Bug

## 🎯 The Problem

Products were loading but not showing because of **PRICE RANGE FILTER**!

### The Bug:
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN)
const [priceRange, setPriceRange] = useState([0, 2000]);
```

### Your Product Prices (in DZD):
- iPhone 14 Pro Max: **85,000 DZD** ❌ (filtered out!)
- Samsung S23 Ultra: **75,000 DZD** ❌ (filtered out!)
- iPhone 13: **45,000 DZD** ❌ (filtered out!)
- Xiaomi 13 Pro: **55,000 DZD** ❌ (filtered out!)
- Samsung A54: **32,000 DZD** ❌ (filtered out!)

**ALL products were > 2,000 DZD, so ALL were filtered out!**

---

## ✅ The Fix

```javascript
// NEW (FIXED)
const [priceRange, setPriceRange] = useState([0, 100000]);
```

Now all products are within the price range and will display!
