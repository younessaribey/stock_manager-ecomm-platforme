## 🔄 IMPORTANT: Clear Browser Cache

Since the data is stored in `localStorage`, you need to clear it to see the new images!

### Option 1: Clear localStorage (Recommended)

1. Open your site: https://stock-manager-ecomm-platforme.vercel.app
2. Open Browser Console (F12)
3. Run this command:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

### Option 2: Hard Refresh

- **Windows/Linux:** Ctrl + Shift + R
- **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R
