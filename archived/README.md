# Archived Files

This folder contains old code and documentation that's no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Contents

- **old-docs/** - Old markdown documentation files
- **server/**, **backend/**, **api/**, **db/** - Old Express backend implementations
- Various old deployment scripts and configs

## Why Keep This?

- Historical reference
- Migration documentation
- Understanding the evolution of the project

## Should I Use This?

**No.** Use the main `nestjs-backend/` folder for current code.

These files are archived because:
- They're outdated
- They've been replaced by better implementations
- They're from previous iterations of the project
